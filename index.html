    <h1>Privacy Policy for Garbage Tracker</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2024</p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>ðŸ”’ Your Privacy is Protected</h3>
        <p><strong>Simple Summary:</strong> Garbage Tracker does not collect, store, or share any of your personal data with anyone. Everything stays on your device, period.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>None.</strong> Garbage Tracker does not collect any personal information, usage data, or analytics. The app works entirely offline without any internet connection required.</p>

    <h2>How Your Data is Stored</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pickup Schedules:</strong> Stored locally on your device using iOS secure storage</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Waste Types:</strong> Stored locally on your device only</li>
        <li><strong>Notification Settings:</strong> Stored locally on your device only</li>
        <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Stored locally on your device only</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you delete the app, all your data is permanently deleted with it. We cannot recover it because we never had access to it.</p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>The app requests permission to send local notifications to remind you about garbage pickups. These notifications are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Generated locally on your device</li>
        <li>Do not transmit any data to external servers</li>
        <li>Can be disabled at any time in iOS Settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p><strong>We don't share anything because we don't collect anything.</strong> Your garbage pickup schedule is completely private and stays only on your device.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Garbage Tracker does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. No data is transmitted to any external services.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is completely safe for users of all ages as it does not collect any personal information whatsoever.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data remains on your device using iOS secure storage, your information is protected by your device's built-in security features including device passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect your data, there's nothing for us to delete, modify, or export. You have complete control over your data directly through the app.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date above and notify users through app updates if necessary.</p>

    <div class="contact">
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or the app, please contact us at:</p>

        <h3>ðŸŒ± Built with Privacy in Mind</h3>
